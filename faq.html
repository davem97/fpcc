    <h1>FAQ</h1><br>
    <p><b>Disclaimer:</b> This asset is intended to be a First Person character controller (which means 3D) 
      and so all features and aspects of this project have been<br> designed and coded for that
      purpose. No testing has been done to confirm whether all aspects of this asset 
      support 2D physics and movement.</p>

      <h2>What is your "First Person" character controller?</h2>
      <p>This character controller is a first-person based character which uses a capsule as the default player 
character and also uses the in-built character controller as well as<br> a script that goes along with it 
which expands on that much more and handles all of the character requirements.</p>

<h2>Why did you decide to use the in-built character controller?</h2>
  <p>The main focus of this asset is to provide a character controller that anyone can use, especially those who are either beginners or have intermediate knowledge of Unity.<br>
  Using the default character controller allows for a more straight forward, basic approach while still creating more intricate functions around it. It is also a controller that<br>
  many users are familiar with or have very basic knowledge of, which allows for a much briefer introduction into this asset while still being able to expand on as much<br> as desired.</p>

<h2>Does this asset support both the old and new input systems?</h2>
<p>At the moment this asset only directly supports the old input system with the code reflecting that, but there is no reason why the user should not be able to<br> implement one or 
the other, or both.</p>

<h2>Is there Third Person available?</h2>
<p>There is a third-person camera available with this asset but since it is aimed at being a first-person project, the third-person camera has very limited<br> functionality
and is there more just to show that the project is capable of working just fine with a third-person movement system instead of the default first-person movement.</p>

<h2>What type of games is this asset aimed at producing?</h2>
<p>The main design focus was to turn this into a fast-paced, arcadey
first-person shooter game. But this asset can be used to create any type of game,
such as a horror game,<br> survival game, RTS game (with some custom adjustments) and so on.</p>

<h2>How is collision handled?</h2>
<p>The character controller can collide with other controllers and the enviroment including other colliders 
and has very basic interactions with Rigidbodies. The asset was<br> created with more of a "sandbox" shooter 
feel, so essentially collision works at a standard level but in its current state, the character controller
cannot push around<br> objects that contain a Rigidbody, and Rigidbody objects cannot push around the controller
with proper physics and mechanics.</p>

<h2>How do you handle the camera?</h2>
<p>There are 2 different cameras that are used, with one specifically intended for movements with the character 
itself, and the other which deals with anything attached<br> to the player (hands, arms, weapons, or other objects), 
and contain different settings for rendering, etc.</p>

<h2>Can a humanoid character be used in place of the default capsule?</h2>
<p>Yes, there is no reason that a humanoid character would not work in place of the default capsule that this asset
comes with. Nothing has been implemented to tie this<br> asset to a capsule character, but you will need to
make some custom adjustments to get your humanoid character to function as you would like.</p>
